                About 97% of Pakistanis are Muslims, so we start our journey in
                a religious place. The Badshahi Mosque is a Mughal-era mosque,
                in the past it was also used for military purposes. The mosque
                is located west of Lahore Fort along the outskirts of the Walled
                City of Lahore, and is widely considered to be one of Lahore's
                most iconic landmarks. It has a capacity for 100,000 worshipers.
                To visit this place you have to enter without shoes and if you
                are a woman you should cover your hair.

                  Minar-e-Pakistan is a national monument located in Lahore. The
                  tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the
                  All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which
                  was latter called Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the
                  first official call for a separate and independent homeland
                  for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the
                  two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to
                  the emergence of an independent Pakistani state in 1947.

                  The Lahore Fort is a citadel in the city of Lahore. The
                  fortress is located at the northern end of Walled City of
                  Lahore (also known as Old City). In the 16th century, Lahore
                  became Mughal Emperor Akbar’s capital and, in circa 1580 he
                  established the Lahore Fort as it is known today. The Alamgiri
                  Gate of Lahore Fort was built by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb
                  Alamgir in 1673. It is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort
                  from west facing Badshahi Mosque. The huge arched entrance in
                  the centre was designed to allow the emperor’s elephant
                  mounted caravan to pass through.

                  reconstructed and opened in 2012 as a tourist attraction. I
                  especially recommend visiting the Haveli restaurant which
                  offers an outstanding view of Badshahi Mosque, delicious food

                  People in Pakistan drive on the left side of the road because
                  Pakistan is a former British colony. On the streets you can
                  see mostly motorbikes and rikshas. Traffic is very high and
                  drivers communicate with each other mostly by horn. Some ease
                  for traffic creates Lahore Metrobus and Lahore Metro (only one
                  line). It is important to note that Lahore is home to more
                  than 11 million people and has one of the most polluted air in
                  the world. Air pollution in Lahore is caused by a combination
                  of vehicle and industrial emissions.

                  Empire was at its artistic and aesthetic zenith, and are now
                  one of Pakistan's most popular tourist destinations. The
                  construction of these gorgeous gardens dates back to 1637 AD.
                  Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, ordered these pleasure
                  gardens to be built in the Persian style. The Shalamar Garden
                  Lahore contains 410 fountains, which discharge into wide
                  marble pools.

                  Ravi River. Construction of the mausoleum lasted 10 years.
                  Dilkusha Garden in which Jahangir was buried was a "favourite

                  jointly followed since 1959. The drill is characterised by

                  high as possible. It is alternatively a symbol of the two

                  The motorway passes through the Salt Range mountains. The Salt
                  Range is a hill system in the Punjab province of Pakistan,
                  deriving its name from its extensive deposits of rock salt. In
